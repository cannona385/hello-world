GitHub Tutorial Repository
I'm Alex Cannon, from Las Vegas, NV USA. I moved to Providence, RI USA in July 2017 and work at Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island as a Data Warehouse Analyst. I'm learning to use GitHub to further my knowledge of new technologies and platforms for use in personal and work applications.
